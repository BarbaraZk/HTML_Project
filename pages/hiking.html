        Hiking for me is my favourite hobby. I am focused on the day hikes which
        i now do on the weekly basis throughout the year. Hiking is great way to
        forget about work stuff and enjoy walking around in the nature. Moreover
        finding and exploring new places around the nature is very exiting.
        Hiking is also a good exercise, improving and supporting your mental
        health, and reduce the risk of depression.
